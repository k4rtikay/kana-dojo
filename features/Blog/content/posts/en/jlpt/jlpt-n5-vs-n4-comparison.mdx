## The Difficulty Jump Explained

### Why N4 Feels So Much Harder

**1. Exponential Knowledge Required**

- Not linear progression
- Grammar patterns build on each other
- Vocabulary becomes contextual

**2. Less Furigana Support**
You must recognize N5 kanji without help, while learning new N4 kanji.

**3. Speed Requirements**
Reading and listening speeds increase significantly.

**4. Inference Required**
Can't rely on direct statements - must read between the lines.

**5. Complex Grammar Stacking**
Multiple grammar patterns in one sentence:
N5: 図書館に行きました。(I went to the library.)
N4: 図書館に本を返しに行ったんですが、閉まっていました。
(I went to return a book to the library, but it was closed.)

### Study Hour Reality Check

**Common misconception:** "N5 took me 3 months, so N4 will take 3 months."

**Reality:**

<table>

      <th>Preparation Level</th>
      <th>N5 Time</th>
      <th>N4 Time</th>

      <td>Heritage speaker</td>
      <td>1-2 months</td>
      <td>3-6 months</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intensive study</td>
      <td>1-3 months</td>
      <td>4-6 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<InfoBox type='warning'>
  Plan for N4 to take AT LEAST as long as N5 took you, even though you already
  have foundation. Many learners underestimate this!
</InfoBox>

## Should You Skip N5 and Go Straight to N4?

### Skip N5 if:

- ✅ You've studied Japanese for 300+ hours already
- ✅ You can read hiragana, katakana, and 100+ kanji fluently
- ✅ You understand basic grammar (particles, verb conjugations)
- ✅ You can hold basic conversations
- ✅ You're self-motivated and don't need external validation
- ✅ You want to save time and test fees

### Take N5 if:

- ✅ You're a complete beginner (< 150 hours)
- ✅ You need external motivation/deadlines
- ✅ You want confidence before attempting N4
- ✅ Your school/employer requires progressive certification
- ✅ You want to understand the JLPT format
- ✅ You struggle with self-assessment

### Self-Assessment Test

Can you do these without looking anything up?

**Test 1: Reading**
Read this without hesitation:
私は毎日日本語を勉強します。学校で日本人の先生に教えてもらいます。

**Test 2: Grammar**
Make grammatically correct sentences with:

- [Verb-て form] + います
- [Noun] が 欲しいです
- [Verb-ます stem] + たいです

**Test 3: Listening**
Understand this spoken at normal speed (imagine hearing it):
"明日の会議は10時から12時までです。場所は2階の会議室です。"

**Results:**

- ✅ All easy? Consider starting N4 prep
- ⚠️ Some difficult? Take N5 first
- ❌ Very difficult? Start from basics (pre-N5)

## Common Mistakes in N5 → N4 Transition

### Mistake #1: Rushing Through N5 Review

**Problem:** Weak N5 foundation causes N4 struggles
**Solution:** Spend first month ensuring 90%+ N5 mastery

### Mistake #2: Focusing Only on New Content

**Problem:** Forget N5 knowledge while learning N4
**Solution:** Daily N5 review (15-20 minutes minimum)

### Mistake #3: Underestimating Time Requirements

**Problem:** Planning 3-4 months when 6-8 is realistic
**Solution:** Double your initial time estimate

### Mistake #4: Neglecting Listening Practice

**Problem:** N4 listening speed increase is significant
**Solution:** Daily listening practice (30+ minutes)

### Mistake #5: Not Taking Practice Tests

**Problem:** Content knowledge ≠ test-taking ability
**Solution:** Take 4-6 full practice tests before exam

### Mistake #6: Learning Kanji in Isolation

**Problem:** Can't read compound words despite knowing individual kanji
**Solution:** Learn kanji within vocabulary words

### Mistake #7: Ignoring Weak Areas

**Problem:** Focus on comfortable topics, avoid difficult ones
**Solution:** Spend extra time on lowest-scoring sections

</InfoBox>

## Beyond N4: What's Next?

### N4 → N3 Jump

The N3 jump is even bigger than N5 → N4:

- Vocabulary: 1,500 → 3,750 words (2.5x)

### Alternative Paths

**Option 1: N5 → N4 → N3 → N2 → N1**

- Traditional progressive path
- ~4-7 years from N5 to N1
- Steady, manageable progress

**Option 2: N5 → N3 (skip N4)**

- Possible with strong self-study
- Saves test fees and time
- Higher risk of gaps in knowledge

**Option 3: N5 → Immersion → Higher levels**

- Move to Japan or intensive immersion
- Language school or work environment
- Fastest path for dedicated learners

## Conclusion: Making Your Decision

**Take N5 first if:**

- You're a beginner (< 200 hours study)
